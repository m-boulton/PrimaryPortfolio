                <h3 class="work-card-header">About Myself</h3>
                <p>
                  Throughout my life I have been drawn to understanding current computer technology, I have spent a great deal of time personally building my own computers as well as helping family and friends with their own.
                  <br>
                  Well versed in the windows platform however recently have become more skilled in the linux operating systems, specifically the debian client and some ubuntu.
                  <br>
                  Self taught developer with a strong ability to learn and research coding issues in an efficient manner, spent plenty of time researching the documentation for languages I am currently implementing.
                  <br>
                  Now researching program functions that take me out of the common paths of languages, and most easily accessible information, which has required more time to be spent reading language documentation.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="work-card" id="languagesLearned">
                <h3 class="work-card-header">Coding Languages Learned</h3>
                <p>
                  Initially learned HTML and CSS, decided to add some initial code onto github but didnt continue since was still in a learning stage, then moved on and learned Javascript vanilla, then added some jquery to my projects, at that point decided to learn the Reactjs library and Redux for state management but since the introduction of react hooks; have not needed to implement redux in any projects.
                  <br>
                  After learning these frontend languages decided to host projects on my own virtual private server, while looking into the deployment of these projects I decided to host all future code on my own Git server (instead of github) and use git hooks to deploy to production folders.
                  <br>
                  My Virtual Private Server is based on debian 10, have been able to use the debian client with ssh logins and putty, decided to use nginx as a proxy service and certbot certification keys for https web connections and smtp email services, all backend services are built in nodejs and used a variety of npm packages like Expressjs mongoose nodemailer dotenv and nodemon.
                  <br>
                  Since a database was needed I have been using the Mongodb.com collections Saas and have found it quite efficient.
                </p>

              <div class="work-card" id="currentProjects">
                <h3 class="work-card-header">Current Projects</h3>
                <p>
                  Building a Reactjs based login page that allows an account login and a signup form for new users.
                  <br>
                  Implementing bootstrap for styling, using JWT tokens maintained in the local storage with a refresh token system for administration certificate management.
                  <br>
                  I will be using this login page for future projects that require user credentials, this is already done with authorization services like Google Authenticator and auth0 but I wanted to build an authorization system that utilizes tokens in conjunction with a database.
                </p>

                <h3 class="work-card-header">Future Development</h3>
                <p>
                  Enjoyed learning the MERN stack but strive to learn more languages, planning to move over to a typescript compiler since I believe it will help reduce simple coding errors.
                  <br>
                  Prefer the mongoose package but would like to learn a true SQL language and implement it in future work for better relational database functions.
                  <br>
                  Would like to move into learning how to build android apps and would want to link it to a SMS service.
                </p>

              <div class="work-card" id="history">
                <h3 class="work-card-header">Career History</h3>
                <p>
                  Initially I worked as an industrial electrician for 4 years, I was employed at Syntech Enerflex for two and a half years and then I worked another year and a half at Pronghorn Controls, 
                  <br>
                  then I worked as a self employed contractor for 8 years, the majority of the work was the building exterior railings on decks and patio's.
                  <br>
                  for the past two years I have been developing my coding skills and have really enjoyed the process of building something with a logical component to its behaviour, my first git push was to my github profile in 2019 and since then I have been taking an increased interest in learning more about software engineering.
                </p>

                <h3 class="work-card-header">Interests and Hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                  I enjoy building small microcontrollers based on the arduino ide and teensy microcontroller, I also have an interest in building drones for both FPV and Cinematic dones, through my intersts in small electronics I have developed a skill in soldering and electronics repair.
                  <br>
                  I have always had a deep interest with computer technology since a young age, I have always built my own computer and am quite adept at pc repair and modification, I am well versed on the windows platform and use a windows server that stores the majority of my data, in the future I will be building my own homelab and playing around with virtualization of freenas and parsec.
                  <br>
                  I have always been quite capable with building with my hands and enjoy woodworking and welding, currently I am building my own computer desk with inlayed adressable led strips.
