                <p>
                  Through my life I have been drawn to understanding current computer technology, I have spent a great deal of time personally building my own computers as well as helping family and friends.
                  <br><br>
                  Well versed in the windows platform, recently developed skills in the linux operating system, specifically the debian client and some ubuntu.
                  <br><br>
                  Self taught developer with a strong ability to learn and investigate coding issues in an efficient manner, I have spent plenty of time studying documentation for languages currently being implemented.
                  <br><br>
                  Now researching program functions that take me out of the common paths of languages, and most easily accessible information, which has required more time to be spent reading language documentation.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="work-card" id="languagesLearned">
                <h3 class="work-card-header">Coding Languages Learned</h3>
                <p>
                  Initially learned HTML and CSS, decided to add some initial code onto github but didnt continue since I was still in a learning stage, moved on and mastered Javascript vanilla, then added some jquery to my projects, at that point I chose to learn the ReactJS library and Redux for state management.
                  <br><br>
                  After learning these frontend languages, I chose to host all future projects on a virtual private server, while looking into the deployment of these projects I decided to add a Git Server to the same VPS (instead of github) and use git hooks to deploy to production folders.
                  <br><br>  
                  My Virtual Private Server is based on debian 10, I have been able to use the debian client with ssh logins and putty, decided to use nginx as a proxy service and certbot certification keys for HTTPS web connections and smtp email services, all backend services are built in nodejs and used a variety of npm packages like Expressjs mongoose nodemailer dotenv and nodemon.
                  <br>
                  Since a database was needed I have been using the Mongodb.com collections and have found it quite efficient.
                </p>

              <div class="work-card" id="currentProjects">
                <h3 class="work-card-header">Current Projects</h3>
                <p>
                  Building a Reactjs based login page that allows an account login and a signup form for new users.
                  <br>
                  Implementing bootstrap for styling, using JWT tokens maintained in the local storage with a refresh token system for administration certificate management.
                  <br>
                  This login page will be used for future projects that require user credentials, this is already done with authorization services like Google Authenticator and auth0 but wanted to build an authorization system that utilizes tokens in conjunction with a database.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Enjoyed learning the MERN stack but it is my intention to learn more languages. Planning to implement a typescript compiler since I believe it will help reduce simple coding errors.
                  <br>
                  Prefer the mongoose package but intend to learn an SQL language (MYSQL) and utilize it in future work for better relational database functions.
                  <br>
                  Would like to move into learning React Native and build android apps that use a VOIP/SMS service.
