                <p>
                  Throughout my life I have been drawn to understanding current computer technology, I have spent a great deal of time personally building my own computers as well as helping family and friends with their own.
                  <br>
                  Well versed in the windows platform however recently have become more skilled in the linux operating systems, specifically the debian client and some ubuntu.
                  <br>
                  Self taught developer with a strong ability to learn and research coding issues in an efficient manner, spent plenty of time researching the documentation for languages I am currently implementing.
                  <br>
                  Now researching program functions that take me out of the common paths of languages, and most easily accessible information, which has required more time to be spent reading language documentation.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="work-card" id="languagesLearned">
                <h3 class="work-card-header">Coding Languages I've Learnt</h3>
                <p>
                  Initially I learnt HTML and CSS, I decided to add some initial code onto github but didnt continue since I was still in a learning stage, then I moved on and learnt Javascript vanilla, then I added some jquery to my projects, at that point I decided to learn the Reactjs library and Redux for state management but since the introduction of react hooks I have not needed to implement redux in any projects.
                  <br>
                  After learning these frontend languages I decided to host my projects on my own virtual private server, while looking into the deployment of my code I started to realize I wanted to host all future code on my own Git server (instead of github) and use git hooks to deploy my code to production folders.
                  <br>
                  My vps is based on debian 10, I have been able to use the debian client with ssh logins and putty, I decided to use nginx as a proxy service and certbot for certification keys for https web connections and my smtp email services, all of my backend services are built in nodejs and I used a plethera of npm packages like Expressjs mongoose nodemailer dotenv and nodemon.
                  <br>
                  Since I needed a database to store data I have been using the mongodb.com collections Saas and have found it quite efficient for my use case.

              <div class="work-card" id="currentProjects">
                <h3 class="work-card-header">Current Projects</h3>
                <p>
                  Currently im building a reactjs based login page that allows an account login and a signup form for new users, im implementing bootstrap for styling and using JWT tokens stored in the local storage of the browser with a refresh token system for administration token management.
                  <br>
                  I will be using this login system for future projects that require user credentials, I know this is already done with authorization services like Oauth and authO but I wanted to build an authorization system so that I would be able to work with a token system in conjunction with a database.
                </p>

                <h3 class="work-card-header">Future Development</h3>
                <p>
                  Enjoyed learning the MERN stack but strive to learn more languages, planning to move over to a typescript compiler since I believe it will help reduce simple coding errors.
                  <br>
                  Prefer the mongoose package but would like to learn a true SQL language and implement it in future work for better relational database functions.
                  <br>
                  Would like to move into learning how to build android apps and would want to link it to a SMS service.

                <h3 class="work-card-header">Career History</h3>
                <p>
                  Initially I worked as an industrial electrician for 4 years, I was employed at Syntech Enerflex for two and a half years and then I worked another year and a half at Pronghorn Controls, 
                  <br>
                  then I worked as a self employed contractor for 8 years, the majority of the work was the building exterior railings on decks and patio's.
                  <br>
                  for the past two years I have been developing my coding skills and have really enjoyed the process of building something with a logical component to its behaviour, my first git push was to my github profile in 2019 and since then I have been taking an increased interest in learning more about software engineering.

              <div class="work-card" id="hobbies">
                <h3 class="work-card-header">Interests and Hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                  I enjoy building small microcontrollers based on the arduino ide and teensy microcontroller, I also have an interest in building drones for both FPV and Cinematic dones, through my intersts in small electronics I have developed a skill in soldering and electronics repair.
                  <br>
                  I have always had a deep interest with computer technology since a young age, I have always built my own computer and am quite adept at pc repair and modification, I am well versed on the windows platform and use a windows server that stores the majority of my data, in the future I will be building my own homelab and playing around with virtualization of freenas and parsec.
                  <br>
                  I have always been quite capable with building with my hands and enjoy woodworking and welding, currently I am building my own computer desk with inlayed adressable led strips.
